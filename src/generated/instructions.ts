If no, continue testing the protected method.\n- Arrange, Act, Assert is a good pattern.\n- Vague test names using words like \"correct\", \"properly\", or \"should work\" make it difficult to understand what broke when tests fail and should therefore be avoided. \n- Do not test things like \"if I mock X to return Y, X should return Y\".","typescript":"# TypeScript Testing Instructions\n\n- Always use `data-testid` attributes over css selectors.","python":"# Python Testing Instructions\n\n- All tests should go into the top level tests directory\n- Each test name follows the pattern: test_when_[INPUT]_[ACTION]_[EXPECTED_OUTPUT]\n"};
