Walkthrough the changes on this branch and review the PR: 

## Stage 1 - Vibe Check
- Any high level concerns? 
- What parts are confusing? 

## Stage 2 - Reduce, Recycle, Reuse
- Identify the pieces that are net new additions.
	- Describe them. 
	- Are there any opportunities to reuse existing functionality? 

## Stage 3 - Well Actually
- Pick a piece of code from the PR and show me how you would write it instead. 
- Use this as an opportunity to teach me about any new additions to the language or framework that I may not have been aware of. But only if it's relevant. I learn best when I can apply concepts or techniques in my day to day.

## Stage 4 - Final Sweep
- Are all the drawers closed? Logs cleaned up? Have all the docs been updated?
